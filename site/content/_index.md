  text: >-
    Do you believe that real estate transactions should be left up to instinct?
    If not, we are here for you. We carefully collect and analyse market data
    for the area of London, and give you, the buyer or seller of a property, the
    information that will help you reach a decision. 
intro:

    We create market reports, property reports and valuations, general area and
    neighbourhood reports on schools, crime, shops and everything else we think
    is relevant to buying or selling property in London.

      If you are a seller, we can give you estimates of your property's market
      value. We also develop tailor made strategies to market each property,
      which includes lead generation through online and offline marketing,
      informal auction planning and data driven profit maximisation.

      If you are a buyer, we can generate detailed reports for the properties
      you are interested in. This includes reports on the neighbourhood and
      general area around the property, and can be customised to your needs.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
